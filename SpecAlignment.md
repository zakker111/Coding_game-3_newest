# Spec alignment to current engine behavior (rulesetVersion `0.2.0`, schemaVersion `0.2.0`)

## Goal

Make the Markdown “spec” documents match (and therefore **lock**) the behavior of the deterministic engine in:
- `packages/engine/src/sim/runMatchToReplay.js`

Primary implementation references:
- `packages/engine/src/sim/runMatchToReplay.js`
- `packages/engine/src/sim/constants.js`
- `packages/engine/src/sim/bulletSim.js`
- `packages/engine/src/sim/powerupSim.js`
- `packages/engine/src/sim/arenaMath.js`

## Current implemented contract: `rulesetVersion = 0.2.0`

### Locked items (0.2.0)
If you change any of these, bump `rulesetVersion` and update all relevant docs/tests.

- Per-bot `loadout`: exactly 3 slots (`[slot1, slot2, slot3]`), each `"BULLET"|"SAW"|"SHIELD"|"ARMOR"|null`.
- Default-empty: missing/omitted loadout resolves to `[null, null, null]`.
- Deterministic normalization + `loadoutIssues` surfacing (unknown → null, dedupe, max 1 weapon among `BULLET|SAW`), intended to be shown as a **visible, non-blocking warning/error** in consumers.
- `ARMOR` passive:
  - mitigation for all damage: `amount - floor(amount/3)` (~33%)
  - speed penalty when equipped: `floor(12 * 3/4) = 9`
- Bullet mitigation ordering when both apply: `SHIELD` then `ARMOR`.
- Bullet targeting (v1):
  - `TARGET_CLOSEST_BULLET` selects the closest enemy bullet by Manhattan distance.
  - Tie-break is deterministic by numeric bullet creation order (`B1 < B2 < …`).
  - `MOVE_AWAY_FROM_TARGET` uses the resolved target position (bot > bullet > powerup).

### Replay header
- `schemaVersion` is emitted as `'0.2.0'`.
- `rulesetVersion` is emitted as `'0.2.0'`.
- `bots[i].loadout` is a 3-slot array (`[slot1, slot2, slot3]`), where each entry is a module id (`"BULLET"|"SAW"|"SHIELD"|"ARMOR"`) or `null`.
- `bots[i].loadoutIssues` may be present (informational) if the engine had to normalize an invalid loadout.

### Loadout rules (v0.2.0)
- Default-empty loadout rule: if `loadout` is missing/omitted at match input time, treat it as `[null, null, null]`.
- Invalid loadouts do not abort the match; they are **deterministically normalized** and issues are recorded.
  - Unknown module id → `null` + `UNKNOWN_MODULE`
  - Duplicate module → keep earliest slot, later duplicates → `null` + `DUPLICATE`
  - Multiple weapons (more than one of `BULLET|SAW`) → keep earliest weapon, later weapons → `null` + `MULTI_WEAPON`

### Tick ordering (engine phase order)
1. Bot VM execution (`BOT1..BOT4`) + `BOT_EXEC` (bullets may spawn here)
2. Toggle drains (SAW/SHIELD energy drain; auto-off at `energy == 0`)
3. Movement + collision resolution (Bresenham stepping for overlap detection)
4. SAW damage
5. Bullet simulation (`BULLET_MOVE/HIT/DESPAWN` + `DAMAGE`)
6. Powerup pickups
7. End-of-tick maintenance (cooldowns, bump flags shift to `*LastTick`, powerup TTL, powerup spawns, target-powerup invalidation)
8. Match end check + `MATCH_END`

### Movement + collision
- Base speed is `12` units/tick.
- With `ARMOR` equipped: `floor(12 * 3/4) = 9` units/tick.
- Collision detection walks integer points along the move segment using Bresenham.
- **Wall bump damage is suppressed if a bot bump occurs**.

### Weapons / modules
- Bullets:
  - damage `10`, speed `16`, TTL `18`, ammo cost `1`, cooldown `4`
  - muzzle-offset spawn is outside shooter AABB (`BOT_HALF_SIZE + 2 = 10` via L∞ normalization)
  - collision via Bresenham-stepped points (not analytic time-of-impact)
- SAW:
  - damage `6` per tick, energy drain `1` per tick, range `18` units (Euclidean check)
- SHIELD:
  - energy drain `1` per tick
  - bullet mitigation: 50% reduction (`amount - floor(amount/2)`)
- ARMOR:
  - passive mitigation (all damage sources): `amount - floor(amount/3)`
  - ordering for bullet hits when SHIELD is active: apply SHIELD first, then ARMOR

### Environmental damage
- Wall bump damage `2`.
- Bot bump damage `1` to both bots (attributed to the other bot for kill credit), applied at most once per unordered bot-pair per tick.

### Powerups
- Spawn interval: uniform `10..20` ticks
- Max active: `6`
- Lifetime: `30` ticks
- Deltas: `HEALTH +30`, `AMMO +20`, `ENERGY +30`
- Spawn locations: 45 anchors in stable order (sector asc; center then zones 1..4)
- Spawn avoids:
  - occupied anchors
  - anchors currently inside any alive bot AABB
- Type distribution: uniform among `HEALTH|AMMO|ENERGY`

## Legacy notes: `rulesetVersion = 0.1.0`

- No explicit per-bot loadouts; module capability was inferred by scanning `sourceText` for tokens like `SAW` / `SHIELD`.
- `ARMOR` did not exist.
